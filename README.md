## Running DecapCMS to edit posts locally

First start the dev server with `pnpm dev`, then run `pnpm cms`.
You can now edit your posts at [http://localhost:4321/decapcms/index.html](http://localhost:4321/decapcms/index.html). Posts are only modified locally and still need to be pushed to Github.

NOTE: DecapCMS is disabled in production due to auth issues.
